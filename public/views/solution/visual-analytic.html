                        To take the mroe advanced and more accurate decisisions it is necessary for business leaders, that they have correct and accurate representation of data.
                        Many times business leaders are required to take the decisions on very fast pace rather then waiting and analyzing the data. Visual representation of 
                        data gives a summarized view of data to its viewer.

                        A business leader needs not to look into the actual raw data or tabular data, if he has visual representation of data as per his need. He can easily transform 
                        his information into action with the help of visualized data in form of graphs or other visual representation.
                        
                        A visual representation also helps him in memorizing the same for a very long time as humen mind stores the visual figures in sub concious minds very easily
                        and that too for a quite long time.
